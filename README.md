TCO 5—Given a simple problem that requires iteration, create a solution algorithm that employs loops.TCO 8—Given a more complex problem, develop a complete solution that includes a comprehensive statement of the problem, complete program design, and program documentation.

ScenarioYour algorithm will keep track of a customer’s purchases at the local fireworks stand. Customers will not know exactly how many items they will purchase, so using a For loop on this lab is not allowed. Let’s keep the rules simple.

• Accept the dollar value of each item purchased from the user until the user is finished.• When purchases are complete, enter a sentinel value of -1 (indicating that the user has finished).• If the item purchased is $50.00 or more, give your customer a 10% discount on the item purchased.• Display all of the purchases to the customer with the original price and the discount price.

Be sure to think about the logic and design first (IPO chart, pseudocode, and flowchart), then code the C# program.RubricPoint distribution for this activity:Lab ActivityDocument Points possible Points receivedVariable list &amp; IPO chart 10Flowchart 15Working program 25Total Points 501—Variable List With Data Type &amp; IPO TableList all variables you will use (use valid variable names).
